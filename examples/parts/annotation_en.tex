  The topic of the work: "Exploring Quantum Effects in Ice Cream Freezing with Vibrational Sound Waves".

  Author of work: A third-year student from the Department of Galactic Dessert Studies.

  Supervisor: Lead Researcher at the Institute of Advanced Tasteology.

  The purpose of the work: to develop an algorithm based on quantum mechanics to optimize the freezing process of ice cream using vibrational sound waves and to create a comprehensive system for analyzing dessert textures on this basis.

  During the research, an analysis of the subject area was conducted, which included studying the problems of ice cream crystallization and the methods of its enhancement. A dataset was prepared and annotated for training the models. In the process, a classifier and a detector based on spectral analysis were trained, which allowed preliminary tests on the effectiveness of texture recognition. Simultaneously, a proprietary quantum computing architecture was developed, the results of which were compared with the results of the spectral classifiers and detectors. The developed model became the foundation for creating a dessert texture analysis system. Within this system, a specialized component for processing sensory data from taste tests was developed. The final system successfully passed testing, confirming its effectiveness and reliability in dessert innovation.
